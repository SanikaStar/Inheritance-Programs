**Java Inheritance Programs**

This folder contains Java programs demonstrating the concept of Inheritance, one of the key pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
These examples help understand how classes reuse and extend properties and behavior from parent classes.

**📌 Concepts Covered**
🔹 Types of Inheritance
Single Inheritance
Multilevel Inheritance
Hierarchical Inheritance
(Note: Java does not support multiple inheritance using classes.)

🔹 **OOP Concepts Demonstrated**
Method overriding
Use of super keyword
Constructor chaining
Accessing parent class members
Code reusability
Polymorphism with inheritance

🎯 **Purpose of These Programs**
These inheritance programs help you:
Understand how Java handles parent-child class relationships
Learn how method overriding works
Understand reusability and extensibility of code
Prepare for Java interview questions
Strengthen core OOP concepts
